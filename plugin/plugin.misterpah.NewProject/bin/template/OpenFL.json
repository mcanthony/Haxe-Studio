"description":"OpenFL (Open Flash Library) is a fast, open-source implementation of the industry-standard Flash API. Unlike the Adobe implementation, OpenFL uses hardware rendering, compiles to native C++ for target platforms and reaches many more platforms than Adobe AIR. OpenFL is also 100% compatible with Flash Player, so you can still target Flash in the browser, or even AIR if you want.. http://www.openfl.org/",
